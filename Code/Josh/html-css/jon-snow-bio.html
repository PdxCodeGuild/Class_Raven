          <span class="got">Jon Snow</span> from infancy, Jon is presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard
          Stark. He is raised by Eddard alongside his lawful children at Winterfell but his true parentage is
          kept secret from everyone, including Jon himself. All the Stark children were given a Dire wolf as a
          pet after Eddard Stark found an abandoned litter of pups after their mother had died, Jon was given
          the runt of the litter and names his wolf Ghost for his solid white fur.

          <span class="got">In</span> order to escape his bastard status Jon joins the Night's Watch and is
          eventually chosen as Lord Commander. However, he is later murdered in a mutiny and resurrected by
          the Red Priestess Melisandre. Freed from his Night's Watch vows, Jon joins his sister, Sansa Stark,
          in building an army and together they retake Winterfell from House Bolton, restoring House Stark's
          dominion over the North with Jon being declared the new King in the North. However, after
          successfully capturing a white walker and presenting it to the Lannisters as proof that the Army of
          the Dead is real, Jon pledges himself and his army to Daenerys Targaryen and steps down as King in
          the North."
