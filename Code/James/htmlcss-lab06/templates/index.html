                In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the
                shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest
                and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of
                substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced
                by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For
                example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would
                become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used
                it in his private correspondence.[1] The encryption step performed by
                a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes,
                such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the
                ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the
                Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers
                essentially no communications security. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Link to wikipedia</a>
