                <p>I need a fake passport, preferably to France…I like the way they think. Yes, Annyong. Your name is Annyong! We all know you're Annyong! Oh, I can just taste those meaty leading man parts in my mouth. You stay on top of her, Buddy. Don't be afraid to ride her. Hard. Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. Happy Franklin Friday. Turn this skiff around!
                    Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn? Daddy horny, Michael. Say goodbye to THESE! <br><br> I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch!                    
                    I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. Operation Hot Mother. He's a regular Freddie Wilson, that one. I was hoping he would be gifted sexually. If this were a Lifetime Moment of Truth movie, this would be our act break. But it wasn't.          Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt?
                    I think I might have someone who's going to circumvrent the law. <br><br> Look at us, crying like a bunch of girls on the last day of camp. Chaw-chee, chaw-chee chaw-chee! Coo coo ca cha! Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. Steve Holt? The moron jock? Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on the balcony until zip-up, and yet anything goes at bath time.
                    I didn't mean who… I meant… her? She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. Well, Michael, I did not find their buffoonery amusing. It's one banana Michael, what could it cost, ten dollars? Talk you off what, Pop Pop? Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough.
                    I need a fake passport, preferably to France… I like the way they think. <br><br> Say goodbye to THESE! I'll be in the hospital bar. You know there isn't a hospital bar, Mother. Well, this is why people hate hospitals. Do you guys know where I could get one of those gold necklaces with the T on it? That's a cross. Across from where? Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. Teamocil. No, I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens.
                    I guess you can say I'm buy-curious. She's trying to prove that she's closer to my children than I am, but the joke's on her, because she doesn't know how little I care for GOB. <br><br> Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we. This was a big get for God. Taste the happy, Michael! Taste it!
                    Michael, look, this has got to stop. I mean, flattered? Yes. Interested? Not tonight. <br><br> She's a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? Hey, look at that – you're mean sober, too.
                    It's OUR nausea. Touché, Pandora. There's unlimited juice? This party is gonna be off the hook. I deceived you, mom. Tricked makes it sound like we have a playful relationship. Did Ted make an appointment? No. Well then Ted can GET THE HELL OUT OF THIS OFFICE! YOU GET THE HELL OUT! Don't ask "Can I"… ask "I Can!"</p>
