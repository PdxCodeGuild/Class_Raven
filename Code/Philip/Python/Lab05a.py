'''A palindrome is a word that's the same forwards or backwards, e.g. racecar. Another way to think of it is as a word that's equal to its own reverse.

Write a function check_palindrome which takes a string, and returns True if the string's a palindrome, or False if it's not.

>>> enter a word: racecar
>>> 'racecar' is a palindrome

>>> enter a word: palindrome
>>> 'palindrome' is not a palindrome'''

palindrome = input("Enter a word: ")
if palindrome == palindrome[::-1]:
    print('Palindrome')
else:
    print('Not Palindrome')
