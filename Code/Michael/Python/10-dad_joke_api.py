Dad Joke API
Use the Dad Joke API to get a dad joke and display it to the user. You may want to also use time.sleep to add suspense.

Part 1
Use the requests library to send an HTTP request to https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ with the accept header as application/json. This will return a dad joke in JSON format. You can then use the .json() method on the response to get a dictionary. Get the joke out of the dictionary and show it to the user.

Part 2 (optional)
Add the ability to "search" for jokes using another endpoint. Create a REPL that allows one to enter a search term and go through jokes one at a time. You can also add support for multiple pages.

requests.get(url, {'accept': 'application/json'})
