  Pick6
Michael B

Generate a list of 6 random numbers representing the winning tickets
Start your balance at 0
Loop 100,000 times, for each loop:
Generate a list of 6 random numbers representing the ticket
Subtract 2 from your balance (you bought a ticket)
Find how many numbers match
Add to your balance the winnings from your matches
After the loop, print the final balance
The ROI (return on investment) is defined as (earnings - expenses)/expenses. Calculate your ROI, print it out along with your earnings and expenses.
