Lab 20: Adventure Game

Create a Character and Enemy class.

Create a game board with a list of lists.

Randomly place enemies on the board.

Write a REPL that allows the character to move around
the board until they encounter an enemy, then battle
the enemy until one of the characters is defeated.

If the character defeats all the enemies, they win. Otherwise, they lose.
