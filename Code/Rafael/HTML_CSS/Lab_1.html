            <br>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Porsche 911 is an iconic 2-door sports car. It was first manufactured in Germany in 1964. Future Generations have maintained the iconic 911 name, however the transcending generations are given their unique designation to pair with the 911 heritage name. For example the original 911 was coined only "911" in comparison to later models, like today's 2022 generation as 911(992 Gen).
            </p>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first 911 Turbo model came into development around 1972 and was released in 1974-75. The Turbo made 260 horsepower from a 3.0 liter turbocharged engine. This turbo was part of the 930-911 generation. It was also the fastest production car at its time. It also stood out from its 911 counterparts at its time because of the wide hips and large rear wing.  
            </p>       
            <p class="bio-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequently the newer 992 Generation 911 Turbo is also one of the fastest production cars around. It achieved a zero-to-60-mph time of only 2.2 seconds and crossed the quarter mile in 10.1 seconds at 137 mph. This 992-911 Turbo generation has a 3.8 liter with 640 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. A key factor for its increased performance over the previous generation is its variable turbine geometry turbos which have been vastly improved from its inception in the 997 generation.
            </p>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Porsche introduced the first Turbo S model in 1992. It has basically been the top of the line of the 911 Turbo ever since. Only 80 of these S-models were initially produced which has made them quite a collectible item.        
            </p>
            <p class="bio-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A game changer in 1995 for the 911 Turbo was that it was the only Porsche to have twin-turbos along with a permanent All-Wheel-Drive coupled with 400 bhp from a 3.6 litre engine. The AWD was a complete blessing for this vehicle. AWD meant the car was easier to drive and quite a capable performer in year-around weather conditions.
            </p>    
            <p class="bio-paragraph">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest 911 Turbos are currently considered one of the easiest supercars to drive and are quite comfortable too. You can set the suspension to a softer cruise setting, or stiffen it up on the go when you need that extra performance envelope. There is also the adjustable exhaust tone which produces crackles and pops in sport mode which adds to the experience. This paired with the turbine wind of the turbos, the powerful sling-shot intensity is something to behold when your foot hits the floor.

            <br>
			<i class=""><i class="fas fa-industry"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="" style="text-decoration: none;">1974 - 1977 &nbsp Porsche 911 Turbo (930) was the fastest production car in the world at it's launch. 3.0L 4MT (260HP) </a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-car-alt"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">1977-1981 &nbsp Porsche improved the handling and added horsepower. The body style remained similar. 911 Turbo (930) 3.0L with a 4MT (260hp) & 3.3L 5MT (300HP)</a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-car-alt"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">1981 - 1989 &nbsp The Flachbau also known as the "slantnose" became the new idea in styling which improved the aerodynamics of the car. 911 Turbo (930) 3.3L $MT (330HP) </a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-car-alt"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">1990 - 1995 &nbsp For this generation the slantnose went away for a more traditional looking front end with the bug eyes. There was also an added gear from four gears to five. There were two Turbo models at this time for the (964), 3.3L 5MT (320HP) & 3.6L 5MT (360HP) </a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-car-alt"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">1995 - 1997 &nbsp Porsche went away with the two Turbo models offered before and focused on more horsepower from the similar 3.6L engine before it and also added a gear for a total of five. This would also be the last air cooled Turbo. (993) 3.6L 6MT (408HP)</a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-car-alt"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">2000-2006 &nbsp This was the first water-cooled 911 Turbo. It had an elegant presence in its design. Comfort and touring with performance on demand was a game changer. The side air intakes also made it stand out from the non-turbo models and showed that it meant business. All-wheel drive became the standard for the 911 TURBO as it has continued the AWD into later generations. This was also the first automatic transmission for the 911 TURBO. This was also the first of the "S" models with increased performance and braking. (996) 3.6L 5AT & 6MT (420hp) S(450HP)</a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-car-alt"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">2006 - 2009 &nbsp This was the 6th generation of the Porsche Turbo. It offered rounder from headlights reminiscent of the older generations. It also had the air intakes at the rear with a more aggressive look. Power went up nicely as well compared to the 996 generation. This gen 911 Turbo (997) had a 3.6L 5AT or 6MT (480HP) S(530HP)</a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-car-alt"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">2009 - 2011 &nbsp This Gen 911 Turbo was still known as the (997), it had an improved automatic transmission with 7 gears compared to its predecessor. Power remained at 500HP but with inceased engine displacement. Paired with the all-wheel-drive it was one of the best all-season sports car out there. (997) 3.8L 6MT or 7AT (500HP) S(530HP)</a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-car-alt"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">2013 - 2016 &nbsp This newest 911 Turbo in the mid 2000's designated (991) kept moving the bar even further. There was a 20HP increased. The car has more prominent rear-end intakes and unique modern looking split rear tail-lights. (991) 3.8L 7AT (520HP) S(560HP)  </a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-car-alt"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">2016 - 2020 &nbsp With an increase in 20 horsepower the 911 Turbo lineups just kept improving. This designation would be known as the 991.2. The front design of the car became more aggressive and functional in its styling and front air intakes. The rear quarter panel intakes remained the same. The interior became more modern and refined. (991.2) 3.8L 7AT (540HP) S(580HP)     </a></i>
			<br>
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-flag-checkered"></i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a style="text-decoration: none;">2020 - Present &nbsp Keeping up with its heritage of continual improvement this 992 Gen really did it well. Not only an increase in horsepower but a total redesign of the interior / exterior / mechanics. The tail light is now a unison bar across the back and the led front light are a marvel to see. There is also an added gear to the transmission. 911 Turbo (992) 3.8L 8AT S(650HP)</a></i>
