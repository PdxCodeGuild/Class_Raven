a mansized pet

by w c tuttle

author of “magpie’s nightbear” “a bull movement in yellow horse” etc


it was an incongruous group that sat around the rough pine table in
magpie simpkins’s cabin and played pitch by the light of an old smoky
kerosene lamp

magpie simpkins six feet two slender to the point of emaciation with
the face of a scholar above his walruslike mustache sat there peering
at his cards through the only pair of glasses on sleeping creek

magpie had been to missoula a short time before and at the earnest
solicitation of an optician had purchased a pair of glasses sans bows
which he fastened to his person through the medium of a wide silk
ribbon at the present time he wore the ribbon around his neck for
safety

tellurium woods the second of the trio was as fat as any outdoor man
could ever expect to be and his bald head and luxuriant brown beard
gave one the impression of looking at a billiard ball on a rug
tellurium affected buckskin shirts of his own manufacture and design
and it was impossible to tell at the neck just where the shirt left
off and the skin began

bantie weyman was the exact opposite of the others he was about five
feet two inches in height and would weigh about a hundred he had a
soprano voice a gold tooth and took baths in the latter he differed
from any one else on the range

bantie wasn’t exactly a man’s man but he did a man’s work on his claim
in bear gulch and claimed to be the champion sourdough breadmaker of
the world bantie was timidso timid that he wouldn’t pack a gun and
the only armament of his cabin consisted of a 22 rifle with a section
of cleaningrod broken off inside the barrel

these three represented the social column of sleeping creek their
cabins were situated within a radius of two miles and in order to keep
up the social life of the district they had instituted a private pitch
clubtwo bits a corner and ten cents set back the three were to
alternate as hosts

at this their first session there was a fourth party present it
seemed very much interested in the hands held by bantie much to
bantie’s embarrassment and to the huge delight of the others bantie
played the jack of diamonds and snorted loudly as magpie took it with
the queen and a chuckle

“magpie yuh got to put that bear outside” he shrilled “he gits his
danged nose in m’ ear and i don’t know whether i’m playin’ th’ jack or
th’ ace i got th’ acesee by golly that sets me back three and
costs me ten cents i ain’t goin’ to riffle another card until yuh puts
that emblem uh california out in th’ shed sabe”

“haw haw” roared tellurium “be uh man bantie that pore li’l
grizzly won’t hurt yuh look at him he’s plumb heartbroke over them
words bantie while yore uh fairjist fairpitch player bantie yuh
lacks something if yuh was simply sloppy with th’ milk uh human
kindness like me and magpie you’d git uh pet”

“that ultimatum” replied bantie “covers that wolf uh yours under th’
bunk tellurium every time i turns to spit i got to look into his
shinin’ eyes don’t th’ loafer never sleep”

“well” grinned tellurium “he ain’t no regular rip van winkle but he’s
tametame enough fer uh man i believes in uh mansized pet and fer
that reason i cottons to th’ wolf uh course he’s only good fer uh grown
man”

bantie grunted and put on his coat

“my remarks goes as she lays” he stated “i don’t play with no danged
menagerie it’s bad enough to be whipsawed by uh pair uh snakehunters
like you and magpie but i draws th’ line at havin’ uh wolf under m’ feet
and uh grizzly workin’ down wind behind m’ ear why i”

“say tellurium did yuh ever see my bear dance” interrupted magpie

“he’s there four ways from th’ jack watch him now”

magpie slid the table over against the wall and took a rusty goldpan
from behind the stove using it as a tambourine he began a shuffle on
the rough floor

the bear watched him for a minute and then with a squeal of delight got
up on its hind legs and began to prance around the cabin bantie forgot
his fear and began to shuffle too while tellurium sat with his feet
over the end of the bunk and sang “annie laurie” in a husky voice to the
tune of “a hot time”

whether through accident or design the bear danced straight for the
shuffling bantie who was intent on watching his own toes bantie looked
up as the bear was almost against him and he stepped back hurriedly out
of harm’s way at least he was out of the bear’s way but unfortunately
one of his boot heels landed squarely on the front foot of the wolf
under the bunk

a description of the rest of the action would be pure fiction as no one
in the cabin ever knew just what did happen suffice to say that when
the explosion was over magpie was under the table tellurium was under
the bunk the bear was whining up on the rafters bantie and the wolf
were gone and so was the one window to the cabin

it was probably ten minutes later that bantie stuck his head into the
open window and panted

“my remarks still goes as she lays i’ll play solitaire until m’ mind
goes abroad before i’ll play in uh zoo like this again any time you
jaspers want to play with me jist leave th’ specimens tied up sabe”

“did yuh git cut up any bantie” grinned magpie

“lost m’ pants” stated bantie in a soprano voice

tellurium grinned and took a fresh chew

“better git uh pet to keep yuh company fine thing fer uh man”

his accent on the last word irritated bantie so much that he shrugged
his thin shoulders and started off in the dark toward his cabin without
replying

“hey” yelled tellurium “what did yuh do with my wolf”

“he’ll git back some time tomorrow” shrilled bantie “that is if he
don’t lose m’ return trail”

                                               

the next night magpie and tellurium ambled down to bantie’s cabin
ostensibly to square things with bantie but it is worthy of notice that
they took their pets along bantie wasn’t home and the cabin was locked
so they went back to tellurium’s cabin and played singlehanded poker

it was four days later that bantie sat in front of his cabin and the
stoop was gone from his shoulders he was having the time of his life
watching a little gray kitten pull off stunts with an old newspaper

“ain’t he th’ little rascal” he chuckled “gosh he shore is some pet
and that’s whatever i’m shore pleased with his coloryes sir almost
uh dead ringer ferhuh that’s goin’ to be uh good joke if it works
it’s goin’ to require some thinkin’ twenty dollars rent that’s uh
heap uhgosh here comes magpie down th’ trail kitty kitty
kittywell git in th’ house then doggone i got to cache that cat
before he gits here”

bantie was busy with his broom when magpie leaned against the doorway
with a broad grin

“hello bantie when did yuh git back”

“yesterday afternoon come inside while i sweeps this dirt out”

magpie came in and sat down on the bunk

“to see yuh handle that broom bantie reminds me uh heap of uh feemale
person you shore are finicky about yor floor”

bantie blushed through his tan and swept vigorously

magpie saw that he had riled bantie so he continued

“you shore ought to have uh pet around yore cabin uh feller gits uh
heap uh comfort out of uh pet now old man sims down at th’ forks has
got uh litter uh gray kittens and i know he’d shore admire to give yuh
one uh course yuh don’t want nothin’ bigger nor more feerocious than
house cats wild animal pets are only fit fer”

he had started to make a deprecatory gesture with his right hand which
had suddenly come into contact with fur also the fur moved magpie took
one look and then swallowed his tobacco a wildcat was sitting on the
bunk beside him and two big yellow eyes stared into his magpie knew
wildcatsknew that no living animal could move more quickly but if any
wildcat had caught magpie in the next ten seconds it would have set a
new record for the species

bantie dropped his broom as magpie went past and then leaned against the
doorway and watched him slow down a hundred yards away and pull his gun
as he whirled the little gray kitten rubbed against bantie’s leg and he
picked it up and cuddled it to his face as he watched magpie scratch his
neck and then amble off up the trail

to say that magpie was astonished as he plodded off up that trail would
be putting it mildly

“i wonder if that was uh bobcat” he queried aloud “dang it all my
eyes ain’t what they used to be leavin’ my specs to home that away puts
me plumb dim in th’ vision buthuh that shore looked like uh
bobcatyes sir but shucks it ain’t possible bantie with uh
bobcat no siree it ain’t reasonable i tell yuh must ’a’ been my
eyes i reckon”

he went rumbling along the trail with his head down and nearly ran
headlong into tellurium

“whoa yuh old goat” yelled tellurium “what yuh tryin’ to dobutt
yore way home”

“howdy tellurium where yuh goin’”

“reckoned i’d pilgrim down and see if bantie’s got home yet did yuh see
him”

“uhha i stopped by his cabin fer uh spell”

“did he have anything to say about me and you and th’ pets” asked
tellurium with a grin

“not uh word i reckon he’s done forgot it nice li’l feller that
bantie”

“nice enough fer uh runt but i don’t admire th’ breed none he’s too
doggone scary magpie”

“unha” agreed magpie “he shore ain’t got no corner on nerve well i
got to be goin’ come over tonight and play uh little poker i don’t
suppose bantie wants to play but yuh might ask him”

tellurium rambled off down the trail and magpie stood there and watched
him for a while finally he scratched his neck and murmured

“mebby i’d ought to have told him butshucks it wasn’t nothin’not uh
danged thing but jist th’ same ihuh”

bantie was washing a pair of overalls in a battered dishpan when
tellurium hove in sight and he threw them over a stump to dry

“howdy bantie” greeted tellurium with a widemouthed grin “as uh
particular feller you shore got ’em all skinned washin’ overalls
what’s th’ use uh that say i’ll bet you takes uh bath too when nobody
ain’t lookin’ haw haw i knowed uh feller oncet who used to take uh
bath twice uh month regular dang near rubbed all th’ skin off hisself
you ought to git uh buckskin shirt like mine bantie them skin shirts
keep yuh from gittin’ dirtysort a fit so tight th’ dirt can’t git in
sabe”

bantie grinned and dried his hands

“go inside tellurium and sit down while i gits some fresh water i
drinks uh lot uh water this hot weather”

“unha i reckon yuh would” replied tellurium as bantie took the pail
and started for the creek “yes sir i wouldn’t put it uh bit past
yuhdrinkin’ lots uh water”

it was probably two minutes later when bantie came back whistling with
his pail of water and entered the cabin

“this old sleepin’ creek shore produces th’ fine water” he remarked but
there was no responsethe cabin was empty

he walked to the door and looked around but there was no sign of
tellurium

“that’s danged funny” he exclaimed aloud “where in thunder is
tellurium” he went outside and walked around the cabin and then came in
and looked under the bunk

“well i’ll be uh”

he gasped as he pulled an object from under the bunk and held it up to
the light it was a battered old sombrero and in the crown was punched
the initials t w

“mama mine” chuckled bantie “and tellurium shore wasn’t built fer
such speed neither”

the little gray kitten on the bunk voiced its hunger and got a whole can
of precious condensed milk for supper that night

                                               

tellurium went over to play poker with magpie that night but neither of
them mentioned bantie until the evening was nearly over magpie shoved
back from the table and began to polish his glasses on a piece of
buckskin

“my eyes are gittin’ plumb bad” he complained “sometimes i think i see
things and i know doggone well i don’t i reckon i’d better wear my
specs all th’ time”

“reckon i’ll have to git some too” agreed tellurium

“yore vision botherin’ yuh too”

“same as yours”

“when did yuh notice it first”

“this afternoon ihuhsay magpie did yuh notice anythingwell
sort a unusual down to bantie’s”

“say” exploded magpie leaning across the table “did you see it too”

“ felt it is nearer th’ word th’ danged thing kept my sunday hat”

magpie continued to polish his glasses and seemed lost in reflection

“jist about what do yuh reckon it is” questioned tellurium “i didn’t
stay long enough to make uh good estimate”

“you and me both” agreed magpie “what little i saw of it shore
resembled uh bobcat but bein’ hasty thataway uh feller can’t depend
on snap judgement knowin’ bantie like we do i’m inclined to argue that
we both was seein’ things which ain’t”

“well mebby” half agreed tellurium “but if it was it’s th’ first time
that bad eyesight ever caused uh streak uh gray dynamite to crawl my
frame and spit brimstone over my carcass and forcibly take my hat away
mebby i’m seein’ things magpie but if i am i shore didn’t start in th’
lower grades no sir i reckon i got into fast company immediately”

“i’ll tell yuh what we’ll do” continued tellurium getting up and
putting on his coat “we’ll go down there tomorrow and take our pets
along if that is uh bobcat i’d shore admire to have it hop my wolf”

“and git yore wolf all scratched to shoestrings” grinned magpie “my
grizzly is more like it bobcats as uh rule don’t hanker none to climb
th’ frame of grizzlies”

“we’ll take ’em both” replied tellurium settling the argument “i
don’t care a dang what happens jist so i gits my hat back that lid cost
me twelve dollars five years ago and i longs fer it something
scandalous magpie”

                                               

the next morning magpie and tellurium arrived at bantie’s cabin with
their pets the grizzly was a poor leader and magpie was worn out
trying to drag several hundred pounds of protesting bear for two miles
over a trail tellurium was equally tired from having to dig his heels
into the ground all the way trying to hold his wolf to a sedate pace

bantie was sitting in the shady side of his cabin reading and on his
lap lay a little gray kitten tellurium saw the kitten first and stopped
in his tracks but the wolf kept right on going and nearly upset
bantie’s chair the kitten arched its back clawed its way up the side
of the cabin and spat at the wolf from the eaves

“what yuh tryin’ to do” yelled bantie trying to escape from the
attentions of the pets “gol dang it when yuh comes visitin’ why don’t
yuh come alone”

“givin’ th’ pets uh little airin’” mumbled magpie still eying the
kitten on the roof “where did yuh git th’ kitten bantie”

“got him from old man sims uh few days ago i needed company so i gits
th’ kitten didn’t yuh see him when yuh was here before”

“say” continued bantie before magpie had a chance to answer “where
did yuh go th’ other day tellurium when i gits back with that pail uh
water yuh was gone i finds the kitten maulin’ yore hat around th’ floor
and you ain’t no place in sight”

“iihuh you say yuh finds that kitten playin’ with my hat”

bantie picked the hat off the bed and handed it to tellurium

“ain’t that yore hat”

“by golly she shore is” exclaimed tellurium “how do yuh reckon that
hat got down here i must be gittin’ absent minded magpie”

“i reckon yore both that way” grinned bantie “th’ other day magpie is
here sittin’ comfortably on m’ bunk and all to oncet he shoots out of
th’ door and gallops off up th’ trail i stands here plumb surprised
i’m plumb scared that he’s loco”

magpie looked at tellurium in an inquiring way but tellurium’s face was
hopelessly blank

the bear and wolf unleashed wandered into the cabin just as bantie
stood up and remarked

“you fellers might as well come in out of th’ sun mebby it was th’ heat
that affected yuh i’ve got uh li’l bottle of hooch from old man sims’
keg and he told me that it was th’”

“say no more bantie” beamed tellurium starting for the cabin door
closely followed by the willing magpie “old man sims gives me uh shot
uh that stuff oncet and ever since that time i’ve wished”

came a roar of pain and a yelp of surprise and the upheaval started a
streak of roancolored bear with a gray hump on its back hit magpie
dead center knocking him back into tellurium and as they fell the bear
raked them fore and aft and the wolf yipping like the fiends of the bad
place were tied to its tail raced across their prostrate bodies and
disappeared in a cloud of dust up the trail

the wolf running at its best speed was a poor second to the bear the
bear was carrying weight but handled it nicely

bantie leaned against the door frame and shrilled his mirth in a high
key while the little gray kitten stood in the door and looked
inquiringly at the two in the dust

“what in  happened” wailed magpie feeling tenderly of a spot on
his chest where the bear had grasped a foothold

“avalanche” gasped tellurium “top of th’ mountain busted right off
and half of it hit me in th’ beltbuckle i reckon i’d better light uh
match to see if i’m conscious”

magpie gazed ruefully up the trail as he brushed off his clothes

“i wonder what got into them pets gosh uh grizzly shore has uh lot uh
motive power when he gits agoin’ where yuh goin’ tellurium”

“i’m goin’ to find them animiles and see what’s th’ matter gol darn i
wouldn’t take uh fortune fer that wolf he’s uh”

“mansized pet” finished bantie with a grin as he picked up the little
gray kitten and snuggled it to his face “pore li’l kitty did they
scare yuh”

“scare” exploded magpie “i’ll bethuh”

he turned and followed tellurium up the trail and bantie watched them
with an expectant grin on his face the trail led over a point of rocks
above the creek and at that point there was a sheer drop of about
fifteen feet to the water which was about five feet in depth

magpie caught up with tellurium at this place and they stopped to argue
the question beyond them the trail curved sharply around another cliff
of rocks

tellurium shoved his hands into his pockets and faced magpie
belligerently

“it don’t stand to reason magpie that uh house cat”

his argument was cut off the avalanche had returned

being as the two were occupying most of the trail there was no chance to
avoid the shock tellurium had hold of magpie’s arm and the two of them
performed their aerial spin and dip of death as one person

the chase had evidently turned as the wolf was in the lead and using all
the power of its legs and voice to hold that lead the bear was due to
slow up or run over the wolf if the race continued for a hundred yards
further

“leggo my face” spluttered magpie trying to shake tellurium’s grip
loose and grab a trailing willow shoot at the same time “what yuh
tryin’ to do drown me”

“don’t claw megimme room” gasped tellurium he lunged toward the
bank and shook magpie’s hold from the willow

“danged hippopotamus tread water” choked magpie “leggo my arm if i
ever gits yougurglegurgleon dry landleggo”

“what did yuh push me in fer” wailed tellurium

he tried to stand up but the current was too strong and he went
pinwheeling his way down the creek to a sandbar magpie relieved of
tellurium’s clutches managed to grab the bank and pull himself out he
wandered down to where tellurium was pouring the water out of his boots
and sat down disconsolately on a log

“i’d shore admire to know what happened” he remarked “something shore
has happened that i ain’t got no light on now that danged little
kitten ain’thuh i dunno i dunno”

“no it shore ain’t” agreed tellurium foolishly “but if it ain’t what
is i asks yuh magpie what is”

“why ask me” demanded magpie

“do yuh reckon i’m uh palmist i know one thing i’m goin’ over and git
my bear whatever it is it ain’t no place fer bears i reckon i’ll have
to tame that pet all over again let’s go over and interview bantie”

bantie was still standing in the door with his kitten on his arm and he
grinned widely at their dilapidated appearance

magpie wiped his mustache and glared at bantie

“where’s my bear”

“and also that wolf uh mine” snapped tellurium

“do yuh want ’em sudden like or jist natural” inquired bantie

“sudden like suits me” stated magpie “if i could git away from this
place goin’ uh thousand feet uh second i’d feel that i was sort a
loiterin’”

“watch m’ roothouse door” said bantie as he shoved the kitten back
into the cabin and shut the door

the roothouse was simply a dugout under the cabin with a rough hinged
door opening on a slant from the ground the door was closed but not
fastened magpie started to walk over and open it but he moved too late

came a yelp and a grunt of fear and the door heaved up nearly tearing
the hinges off and the bear sailed out of the cellar and streaked for
the nearest tree

the wolf hit only the highest points of the scenery until it came to a
high point across the creek where it stopped long enough to elevate its
nose and voice its displeasure to the world

inside the cabin bantie was down on his hands and knees peering down
into the cellar through a hole made by removing some of the rough
flooring he pulled on a short rope and called softly and a fullgrown
wildcat climbed out of the hole and rubbed affectionately against his
leg bantie tied the leash to the bunk leg and the cat crawled under the
bunk

“by th’ great horn spoon” exclaimed bantie “you shore are some pet
frenchy burgoyne said uh mouthful when he said that yuh didn’t allow
strangers to trespass li’l cat yuh cost me jist twenty dollars rent
but yore shore worth itevery cent i plumb hates to take yuh back but
uh bargain’s uh bargain as uh bareback rider of grizzlies i takes m’
hat off to you li’l bobcat”

outside magpie and tellurium leaned against each other and watched the
wolf bid farewell to humanity

finally evidently with misgivings the bear slid down out of the tree
it gazed at the two with melancholy in its little eyes and then waddled
off into the willows down sleeping creek

tellurium sat down heavily on a log and wiped his bald head with a wet
handkerchief

“this is gittin’ to be th’ dangdest”

“look” exclaimed magpie pointing to the open roothouse door the
little gray kitten was perched on the top step and its little ears
twitched as it looked cautiously about before coming out

“what general sherman said about war goes double fer cats” remarked
tellurium

magpie scratched his neck thoughtfully for a moment and then started off
down the sleeping creek trail on a half run

“where in  yuh goin’” yelled tellurium

magpie stopped for a moment and considered the little kitten on the
roothouse door before he yelled back

“i’m goin’ down to dicker with old man sims before he gits rid of all
that litter uh cats i needs uh pet and i shore admires th’ best there
is”

“you and me both” agreed tellurium fervently and they went down the
trail together
