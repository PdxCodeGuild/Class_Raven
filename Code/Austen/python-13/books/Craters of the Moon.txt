look like coils of irregular rope lava flows of this type are known as pahoehoe a hawaiian word pronounced pahoyoy nd meaning ropey rift volcanism on the snake river plain light playing on cobalt blue lavas of the blue dragon flows caught the inner eye of explorer robert limbert it is the play of light at sunset across this lava that charms the spectator it becomes a twisted wavy sea in the moonlight its glazed surface has a silvery sheen with changing conditions of light and air it varies also even while one stands and watches it is a place of color and silence limbert explored the craters of the moon lava field in idaho in the 1920s and wrote those words for a 1924 issue of ational geographic magazine for several years i had listened to stories told by fur trappers of the strange things they had seen while ranging in this region wrote limbert a sometime taxidermist tanner and furrier from boise idaho some of these accounts seemed beyond belief to limbert it seemed extraordinary that a region of such size and scenic peculiarity in the heart of the great northwest could have remained practically unknown and unexplored on his third and most ambitious trek in 1924 limbert and w c cole were at times left speechless by the lava landscape they explored limbert recounted his impressions in magazine and newspaper articles whose publication was influential in the areas being protected under federal ownership in 1924 part of the lava field was proclaimed as craters of the moon national monument protected under the antiquities act it was created to preserve the unusual and weird volcanic formations the boundary has been adjusted and the park enlarged since then in 1970 a large part of the national monument was designated by congress as the craters of the moon wilderness it is further protected under the national wilderness preservation system until 1986 little was known about limbert except for those facts recounted above that year however a researcher compiling a history of the national monument located limberts daughter in boise the daughter still possessed hundreds of items including early glass plate negatives photographs and manuscripts of her father and that shed more light on his life the early days of idaho and craters of the moon some of these photographs served as blueprints for the national park service in the rehabilitation of fragile spatter cone formations that have deteriorated over the years of heavy human traffic the limbert collection has been fully cataloged by boise state university curators and has already proven to be a valuable resource to historians interested in limbert and this fascinating part of idaho preservation of the area owes much to limberts imaginative advocacy in the true spirit of the west in its earlier days local legends beginning in the late 1800s held that this area resembled the surface of the moon on whichit must now be rememberedno one had then walked geologist harold t stearns first used the name craters of the moon when he suggested to the national park service in 1923 that a national monument be established here stearns found the dark craters and the cold lava nearly destitute of vegetation similar to the surface of the moon as seen through a telescope the name craters of the moon would stick after limbert adopted it in ational geographic magazine in 1924 later that year the name became official when the area was set aside by president calvin coolidge as a national monument under the antiquities act like some other areas in the national park system craters of the moon has lived to see the name that its early explorers affixed to it proved somewhat erroneous by subsequent events or findings when stearns and limbert called this lava field craters of the moon probably few persons other than science fiction buffs actually thought that human beings might one day walk on the moon and see firsthand what its surface is like people have now walked on the moon however and we know that its surface does not in fact closely resemble this part of idaho although there are some volcanic features on the surface of the moon most of its craters were formed by the impact of meteorites colliding with the moon moonscape or not early fur trappers avoided the lava flows along the base of the pioneer mountains at the north of todays park in doing so they followed indian trails such as one found by limbert that resembled a light streak winding through the lava when the sun was directly overhead it could be seen to advantage but at times was difficult to follow think of the years of travel limbert marveled necessary to make that mark on rock at least one indian trail was destined to become part of goodales cutoff an alternative route on the oregon trail that pioneers in wagon trains used in the 1850s and 1860s many adjectives early used for this sceneweird barren exciting awenspiring monotonous astonishing curious bleak mysteriousstill apply it is not difficult today to see why pioneering folk intent on wresting a living from the land did not tackle this volcanic terrain geologists possessed the proper motivation to tackle it however curiosity aroused by this lava field has led several generations of geologists beginning with israel c russell in 1901 and harold t stearns in the 1920s into a deeper understanding of its volcanic origins with ever increasing penetration of its geological history the apparent otherworldliness of craters of the moon has retreatedbut not entirely the national aeronautics and space administration asa brought the second set of astronauts who would walk on the moon to this alien corner of the galaxy before their moonshot here they studied the volcanic rock and explored an unusual harsh and unforgiving environment before embarking on their own otherworldly adventure most types of volcanic features in the park can be seen quite readily by first stopping at the visitor center and then driving the loop road far more features can be seen if you also walk the interpretive trails at the stops along the loop road still more await those who invest the time required to come to feel the mysterious timelessness and raw natural force implicit in this expansive lava field many travelers are en route to yellowstone national park and spend only a couple of hours visiting craters of the moon this is ironic because here you are on the geological track of yellowstone in fact craters of the moon represents what yellowstones landscape will resemble in the future and both areas can supplement your insight into what happens when the earths unimaginable inner forces erupt to its surface llustration ilvery leaves of the buckwheat dot a cinder garden with such regular spacing they

rivers and scenic mountain wilderness its snake river plain region boasts little of these attributes this plain arcs across southern idaho from the oregon border to the yellowstone area at the montanayoming border it marks the trail of the passage of the earths crust over an unusual geologic heat source that now brings the earths incendiary inner workings so close to its surface near yellowstone this heat source fuels yellowstones bubbling spewing spouting geothermal wonders craters of the moon therefore stands as a geologic prelude to yellowstone as its precursor and the ancestral stuff of its fiery secrets when did all this volcanism at craters of the moon happen will it happen again according to mel kuntz and other u geological survey geologists who have conducted extensive field research at craters of the moon the volcanic activity forming the craters of the moon lava field probably started nly 1500 years ago the last eruption in the volcanic cycle ended 200 years ago about the time that julius caesar ruled the roman empire craters of the moon is a dormant but not extinct volcanic area its sleeping volcanoes could become active again in the near future the largest earthquake of the last quarter century in the contiguous united states shook idahos tallest mountain borah peak just north of here in 1983 when it did some geologists wondered if it might initiate volcanic activity at craters of the moon it did not according to kuntz however this is no reason not to expect another volcanic eruption here oonrobably within the next 100 years part two of this handbook explores the still young and rapidly evolving understanding of the fascinating geologic story of craters of the moon todays craters of the moon national monument encompasses 83 square miles of the much larger craters of the moon lava field reaching southeastward from the pioneer mountains the park boundary encloses a series of fissure vents volcanic cones and lava flows known as the great rift volcanic zone this volcanic rift zone is a line of weakness in the earths crust that can be traced for some 60 miles across the snake river plain recent volcanism marks much of its length you can explore the great rift and some of its volcanic features via the parks 7ile loop drive as described in part three of this handbook in the parks northern part you will find spatter cones cinder cones lava flows lava caves and an unexpected variety of wildflowers shrubs trees and wild animals the much larger southern part of the park designated by congress in 1970 as the craters of the moon wilderness area is a vast and largely untraveled region of stark volcanic features flanking the great rift it offers a challenge to serious hikers and explorerslatter day robert limbertswho are prepared for rugged wilderness travel despite its seeming barrenness craters of the moon is indeed home to a surprising diversity of plant and animal life as limbert noted in 1924 in the west the term lava beds of idaho has always signified a region to be shunned by even the most venturesome travelersa land supposedly barren of vegetation destitute of water devoid of animal life and lacking in scenic interest in reality the region has slight resemblance to its imagined aspect its vegetation is mostly hidden in pockets but when found consists of pines cedars junipers and sagebrush its water is hidden deep in tanks or holes at the bottom of large blowuts and is found only by following old indian or mountain sheep trails or by watching the flight of birds as they drop into these places to quench their thirst the animal life consists principally of migrant birds rock rabbits woodchucks black and grizzly bears its scenery is impressive in its grandeur years of patient recordeeping by scientists have fit numbers to limberts perceptive observations the number of species identified includes more than 300 plants 200 insects 8 reptiles 140 birds 30 mammalsand one amphibian the western toad we now call limberts rock rabbit the pika the grizzly is long gone here with few exceptions the parks denizens live mostly under conditions of great environmental stress near constant winds breezeoale in strength sweep across the park to rob moisture from all living things scant soils low levels of precipitation the inability of cinder cones to hold rainwater near the surface and the heat of the summer sunintensified by heatbsorbing black lavasonly aggravate such moisture theft cinder surfaces register summer soil temperatures of over 150f and show a lack of plant cover plants cover generally less than 5 percent of the total surface of the cinder cones a recent study found that when the area is looked at on a parkwide basis most of the land is very sparsely vegetated ess than 15 percent vegetative cover on a scale of sand trap to putting green this would approach the sand trap end of the scale llustration inter snow transforms these landscapes smoothing out both contours and the jagged edges of lavas less lunar in appearance now the park nonetheless maintains an otherworldly aura llustration he park was named in 1924 45 years before humans walked on the moon although we now know more about the moons actual surface the parks name still rings true only a few trees immediately suggest that the large photo was taken on earth in the inset photo astronaut edwin e buzz aldrin walks on the moon near the lunar module into this difficult environment wildlife researcher brad griffith ventured to count mark and scrutinize the mule deer of craters of the moon in may 1980 griffith of the university of idaho conducted a threeear study of the parks mule deer population because the national park service was concerned that this protected and productive herd might multiply so much that it would eventually damage its habitat among other things he would find that the herd has developed a drought evasion strategy that makes it behave unlike any mule deer population known anywhere else by late summer griffith explains plants have matured and dried so that they no longer provide adequate moisture to sustain the deer in this landscape that offers them no free water following about 12 days of warm nights and hot days in late july the deer migrate from 5 to 10 miles north to the pioneer mountains there they find freelowing creeks and the cool moist shade of aspen and douglasir groves and wait out summers worst heat and dryness early fall rains trigger the deers return to the parks wilderness from this oasis in late september to feed on the nutritious bitterbrush until november snowfalls usher them back to their winter range the pristine and highuality forage of the craters of the moon wilderness area historically nearly untouched by domestic livestock grazing has inspired this migratory strategy for evading drought in effect the mule deer make use of a dual summer range a behavioral modification unknown elsewhere for their species their late summer and fall adaptations simply complete the mule deers yearlong strategy for coping with the limits that this volcanic landscape imposes on them griffith explains taking a walk in the park on a midummer afternoon gives you a good opportunity to experience the influence of wind heat and lack of moisture the parks winds are particularly striking the lava that has flowed out of the great rift has built up and raised the land surface in the park to a higher elevation than its surroundings so that it intercepts the prevailing southwesterly winds afternoon winds usually die down in the evening as part of the dynamics of temperature and moisture that determine mule deer behavior this daily wind cycle helps explain why they are more active at night than are mule deer elsewhere these deer do not move around as much as mule deer in less ecologically trying areas they have adapted behaviors to conserve energy and moisture in this environmentally stressful landscape early mornings may find park rangers climbing up a cinder cone to count the deer continuing the collection of data that brad griffith set in motion with his threeear study the rangers still conduct spring and late summer censuses over a recent threeear period the deer populations averaged about 420 animals another several years of collecting will give the national park service a body of data on the mule deer that is available nowhere else the uniqueness of this data about the parks mule deer population would surely please the booster aspect of robert limberts personality likewise the research challenges involved in obtaining it would appeal to his explorer self history has justified limbert on both counts publicity arising from his explorations led to creation of the national monument furthermore that publicity put forth a rather heady claim that history has also unequivocally borne out although almost totally unknown at present limbert prophesied in 1924 this section is destined some day to attract tourists from all america every year tens of thousands of travelers fulfill robert limberts prophecy of more than a halfentury ago part 2 from moonscape to landscape llustration ncaptioned llustration hat last happened here about 200 years ago looked much like this photograph of a volcanic eruption in hawaii bubbling pooling and flowing lava blanketed the landscape as molten materials poured or gushed out of the earth most volcanic phenomena preserved at craters of the moon have been seen in action in hawaii geology of the craters of the moon a 400ileong arc known as the snake river plain cuts a swath from 30 to 125 miles wide across southern idaho idahos official state highway map which depicts mountains with shades of green shows this arc as white because there is comparatively little variation here compared to most of the state upon this plain immense amounts of lava from within the earth have been deposited by volcanic activity dating back more than 14 million years however some of these lavas notably those at craters of the moon national monument emerged from the earth as recently as 200 years ago craters of the moon contains some of the best examples of basaltic volcanism in the world to understand what happened here you must understand the snake river plain basaltic and rhyolitic lavas the lavas deposited on the snake river plain were mainly of two types classified as basaltic and rhyolitic magma the molten rock material beneath the surface of the earth issues from a volcano as lava the composition of this fluid rock material varies basaltic lavas are composed of magma originating at the boundary of the earths mantle and its crustal layer rhyolitic lavas originate from crustal material to explain its past geologists now divide the snake river plain into eastern and western units the following geologic story relates to the eastern snake river plain on which craters of the moon lies on the eastern snake river plain basaltic and rhyolitic lavas formed in two different stages of volcanic activity younger basaltic lavas mostly lie atop older rhyolitic lavas this portion of the plain runs from north of twin falls eastward to the yellowstone area on the wyomingontana border drilling to depths of almost 2 miles near the plains midline geologists found mile of basaltic lava flows lying atop more than 1 miles of rhyolitic lava flows how much deeper the rhyolitic lavas may extend is not known no one has drilled deeper here llustration rossing idaho in an arc the snake river plain marks the path of the earths crustal plate as it migrates over a heat source unusually close to the surface it is believed that the heat source fueling yellowstones thermal features today is essentially the same one that produced volcanic episodes at craters of the moon ending about 200 years ago this combinationa thinner layer of younger basaltic lavas lying atop an older and thicker layer of rhyolitic lavasis typical of volcanic activity associated with an unusual heat phenomenon inside the earth that some geologists have described as a mantle plume the mantle plume theory was developed in the early 1970s as an explanation for the creation of the hawaiian islands according to the theory uneven heating within the earths core allows some material in the overlying mantle to become slightly hotter than surrounding material as its temperature increases its density decreases thus it becomes relatively buoyant and rises through the cooler materialslike a tennis ball released underwatertoward the earths crust when this molten material reaches the crust it eventually melts and pushes itself through the crust and it erupts onto the earths surface as molten lava the earths crust is made up of numerous plates that float upon an underlying mantle layer therefore over time the presence of an unusual heat source created by a mantle plume will be expressed at the earths surfacefloating in a constant direction above itas a line of volcanic eruptions the snake river plain records the progress of the north american crustal plate350 miles in 15 million yearsover a heat source now located below yellowstone the hawaiian chain of islands marks a similar line because the mechanisms that cause this geologic action are not well understood many geologists refer to this simply as a heat source rather than a mantle plume two stages of volcanism as described above volcanic eruptions associated with this heat source occur in two stages rhyolitic and basaltic as the upwelling magma from the mantle collects in a chamber as it enters the earths lower crust its heat begins to melt the surrounding crustal rock since this rock contains a large amount of silica it forms a thick and pasty rhyolitic magma rhyolitic magma is lighter than the overlying crustal rocks therefore it begins to rise and form a second magma chamber very close to the earths surface as more and more of this gasharged rhyolitic magma collects in this upper crustal chamber the gas pressure builds to a point at which the magma explodes through the earths crust explosive rhyolitic volcanism rhyolitic explosions tend to be devastating when the gasharged molten material reaches the surface of the earth the gas expands rapidly perhaps as much as 25 to 75 times by volume the reaction is similar to the bubbles that form in a bottle of soda pop that has been shaken you can shake the container and the pressureottled liquid will retain its volume as long as the cap is tightly sealed release the pressure by removing the bottle cap however and the soft drink will spray all over the room and occupy a volume of space far larger than the bottle from which it issued this initial vast spray is then followed by a foaming action as the less gasharged liquid now bubbles out of the bottle collectively the numerous rhyolitic explosions that occurred on the snake river plain ejected hundreds of cubic miles of material into the atmosphere and onto the earths surface in contrast the eruption of mount saint helens in 1980 which killed 65 people and devastated 150 square miles of forest produced less than 1 cubic mile of ejected material so much material was ejected in the massive rhyolitic explosions in the snake river plain that the earths surface collapsed to form huge depressions known as calderas ike aldron whose root meaning it shares this name implies both bowlhaped and warmed most evidence of these gigantic explosive volcanoes in the snake river plain has been covered by subsequent flows of basaltic lava however traces of rhyolitic eruptions are found along the margins of the plain and in the yellowstone area quiet outpourings of basaltic lava as this area of the earths crust passed over and then beyond the suburface heat source the explosive volcanism of the rhyolitic stage ceased the heat contained in the earths upper mantle and crust however remained and continued to produce upwelling magma this was basaltic magma that because it contained less silica than rhyolite was very fluid the basalt like the rhyolite collected in isolated magma chambers within the crust until pressures built up to force it to the surface through various cracks and fissures these weak spots in the earths crust were the results of earlier geologic activity expansion of the magma chamber or the formation of a rift zone llustration icroscopic cross section of basaltic rock llustration icroscopic cross section of rhyolitic rock cross sections show vastly different textures rhyolitic magma contains more silica it is very thick and does not allow trapped gas to escape easily its volcanic eruptions blast large craters in the earths crust basaltic magma is more fluid and allows gas to escape readily it erupts more gently here in the eastern snake river plain basaltic lava flows almost completely cover earlier rhyolitic deposits continued on page 28

eruption contrasts sharply with recent basaltic flows in volcanic activity in hawaii llustration basaltic flows in hawaii upon reaching the surface the gases contained within the lava easily escaped and produced rather mild eruptions instead of exploding into the air like earlier rhyolitic activity the more fluid basaltic lava flooded out onto the surrounding landscape these flows were fairly extensive and often covered many square miles after millions of years most of the older rhyolitic deposits have been covered by these basaltic lava flows the great rift and craters of the moon craters of the moon national monument lies along a volcanic rift zone rift zones occur where the earths crust is being pulled in opposite directions geologists believe that the interactions of the earths crustal plates in the vicinity of the snake river plain have stretched thinned and weakened the earths crust so that cracks have formed both on and below the surface here magma under pressure can follow these cracks and fissures to the surface while there are many volcanic rift zones throughout the snake river plain the most extensive is the great rift that runs through craters of the moon the great rift is approximately 60 miles long and it ranges in width from 1 to 5 miles it is marked by short cracksless than 1 mile in lengthand the alignment of more than 25 volcanic cinder cones it is the site of origin for more than 60 different lava flows that make up the craters of the moon lava field eight major eruptive periods most of the lavas exposed at craters of the moon formed between 200 and 1500 years ago in basaltic eruptions that comprise the second stage of volcanism associated with the mantle plume theory these eight eruptive periods each lasted about 100 years or less and were separated by periods of relative calm that lasted for a few hundred to more than 200 years these sequences of eruptions and calm periods are caused by the alternating build up and release of magmatic pressure inside the earth once an eruption releases this pressure time is required for it to build up again eruptions have been dated by two methods paleomagnetic and radiocarbon dating paleomagnetic dating compares the alignment of magnetic minerals within the rock of flows with past orientations of the earths magnetic fields radiocarbon dating makes use of radioactive carbon4 in charcoal created from vegetation that is overrun by lava flows dates obtained by both methods are considered to be accurate to within about 100 years a typical eruption at craters of the moon research at the monument and observations of similar eruptions in hawaii and iceland suggest the following scenario for a typical eruption at craters of the moon various forces combine to cause a section of the great rift to pull apart when the forces that tend to pull the earths crust apart are combined with the forces created as magma accumulates the crust becomes weakened and cracks form as the magma rises buoyantly within these cracks the pressure exerted on it is reduced and the gases within the magma begin to expand as gas continues to expand the magma becomes frothy at first the lava is very fluid and charged with gas eruptions begin as a long line of fountains that reach heights of 100 feet or less and are up to a mile in length this curtain of fire eruption mainly produces cinders and frothy fluid lava after hours or days the expansion of gases decreases and eruptions become less violent segments of the fissure seal off and eruptions become smaller and more localized cinders thrown up in the air now build piles around individual vents and form cinder cones with further reductions in the gas content of the magma the volcanic activity again changes huge outpourings of lava are pumped out of the various fissures or the vents of cinder cones and form lava flows lava flows may form over periods of months or possibly a few years longerm eruptions of lava flows from a single vent become the source of most of the material produced during a sustained eruption as gas pressure falls and magma is depleted flows subside finally all activity stops when will the next eruption occur craters of the moon is not an extinct volcanic area it is merely in a dormant stage of its eruptive sequence by dating the lava flow geologists have shown that the volcanic activity along the great rift has been persistent over the last 1500 years occurring approximately every 200 years because the last eruptions took place about 200 years ago geologists believe that eruptions are due here

tunnel llustration ncaptioned indian tunnel looks like a cave but it is a lava tube when a pahoehoe lava flow is exposed to the air its surface begins to cool and harden a crust or skin develops as the flow moves away from its source the crust thickens and forms an insulating barrier between cool air and molten material in the flows interior a rigid roof now exists over the stream of lava whose molten core moves forward at a steady pace as the flow of lava from the source vent is depleted the level of lava within the molten core gradually begins to drop the flowing interior then pulls away from the hardening roof above and slowly drains away and out the roof and last remnants of the lava river inside it cool and harden leaving a tube llustration ava tube llustration reat horned owl many

hundreds of feet high may be built in a few days big cinder butte is a cinder cone at 700 feet high it is the tallest cone in the park the shape develops because the largest fragments and in fact most of the fragments fall closest to the vent the angle of slope is usually about 30 degrees some cinder cones such as north crater the watchman and sheep trail butte were built by more than one eruptive episode younger lava was added to them as a vent was rejuvenated if strong winds prevailed during a cinder cones formation the cone may be elongatedin the direction the wind was blowingrather than circular grassy paisley sunset and inferno cones are elongated to the east because the dominant winds in this area come from the west the northernmost section of the great rift contains the most cinder cones for three reasons 1 there were more eruptions at that end of the rift 2 the lavas erupted there were thicker resulting in more explosive eruptions hey are more viscous because they contain more silica 3 large amounts of groundwater may have been present at the northern boundary of the lavas and when it came in contact with magma it generated huge amounts of steam all of these conditions lead to more extensive and more explosive eruptions that tend to create cinder cones rather than lava flows spatter cones when most of its gas content has dissipated lava becomes less frothy and more tacky then it is tossed out of the vent as globs or clots of lava paste called spatter the clots partially weld together to build up spatter cones spatter cones are typically much smaller than cinder cones but they may have steeper sides the spatter cones area of the park top 5 on the map of the loop drive contains one of the most perfect spatterone chains in the world these

this semirid climate to resist being robbed of moisture by winds and heat a plant may feature very small leaves that minimize moisture loss to evade heat wind and aridity another plant may grow inside

spread out for up to 3 feet to support its aboveground part which is a mere 4 inches high this buckwheat only looks like a dwarf because you can not see its roots continued on page 40 plants adapt to a volcanic landscape llustration ncaptioned water is the limiting factor in plant growth and reproduction both on the lava fields of craters of the moon and on the surrounding sagebrush steppe plants have developed a combination of adaptations to cope with drought conditions there are three major strategies 1 drought tolerance physiological adaptations leading to drought tolerance are typical of desert plant species the tissues of some plants can withstand extreme dehydration without suffering permanent cell damage some plants can extract water from very dry soils sagebrush and antelope bitterbrush exemplify drought tolerance llustration warf monkeyflower llustration uckwheat 2 drought avoidance certain structural modifications can enable plants to retain or conserve water common adaptations of this type include small leaves hairiness and succulence the small leaves of the antelope bitterbrush expose less area to evaporative influences such as heat and wind hairs on the scorpionweed reduce surface evaporation by inhibiting air flow and reflecting sunlight succulent plants such as pricklypear cactus have tissues that can store water for use during drought periods other plants such as wire lettuce avoid drought by having very little leaf surface compared to their overall volume 3 drought escape some plants such as mosses and ferns escape drought by growing near persistent water supplies such as natural potholes and seeps from ice caves many other drought escapers such as dwarf monkeyflower simply carry out their full life cycle during the moist time of the year the rest of the year they survive in seed form llustration ricklypear cactus llustration erns plant microhabitats llustration ncaptioned lava flows most plants cannot grow on lava flows until enough soil has accumulated to support them the parks older volcanic landscapes where soils are best developed are clothed with sagebrushrassland vegetation on younger lava flows bits of soil first accumulate in cracks joints and crevices it is in these microhabitats that vascular plants may gain footholds narrow cracks and joints may contain desert parsley and lava phlox shallow crevices will hold scabland penstemon fernleaf fleabane and gland cinquefoil deep crevices can support the syringa various ferns bush rockspirea tansybush and even limber pine not until full soil cover is achieved can the antelope bitterbrush rubber rabbitbrush and sagebrush find suitable niches on lava flows soils first form from eroded lava and the slow decomposition of lichens and other plants able to colonize bare rock these soils can be supplemented by windlown soil particles until vascular plants gain footholds as plants begin to grow and then die their gradual decomposition adds further soil matter these soil beginnings accumulate in cracks and crevices which also provide critical shade and wind protection deep crevices provide lower temperatures favoring plant survival llustration ubber rabbitbrush llustration yringa cinder gardens compared to the lava flows cinder cones are much more quickly invaded by plants here too however volcanic origins influence plant growth compared to the relatively level lava flows steeply sloping cinder cones introduce a new factor that controls the development of plant communities topography here you find marked differences in the plant communities between the north and southacing slopes southacing slopes are exposed to prolonged intense sunlight resulting in high evaporation of water because of the prevailing winds snow accumulates on northeast sides of cones giving them far more annual water than southwestacing sides receive the pioneering herbs that first colonize cinder cones will persist on southwestacing slopes long after succeeding plant communities have come to dominate northacing slopes it is on these northacing slopes that limber pine first develops in the cinder garden southacing slopes may never support the limber pine but may be dominated by shrubs unweathered cinder particles range in size from 3 to 4 inches in diameter down to very small particles they average about inch in diameter llustration inquefoil llustration ire lettuce ecological conditions at craters of the moon are generally so harsh that slight changes can make the difference for the survival of a plant or other organism life thrives in many rock crevices that are surrounded by barren exposed lava rock of the same physical composition these microhabitats provide the critical shade and increased soil and moisture content required for plant survival over the years particles of soil will naturally collect in rock crevices which also have the effect of funneling precipitation into their depths their shade further protects these pockets of soil and water from wind erosion excessive heat and evaporation and leaching by direct sunlight llustration imber pines are the tree pioneers of the lava terrain their seedlings often find suitable conditions for germination in rock crevices long before surrounding landscapes support tree growth most common of all the parks trees limber pine is named for its flexible branches many park animals depend on this tree in some fashion for their livelihoods llustration imber pine cones stay green and resinous through their first year of development and then turn brown and woody as their seeds mature in the second year cones grow to about 4 inches long at craters of the moon crevices are of such importance to plants that botanists differentiate between narrow shallow and deep crevices when studying this phenomenon narrow crevices will support dwarf goldenweed or hairy goldaster shallow crevices support scabland penstemon fernleaf fleabane and gland cinquefoil deep crevices give rise to syringa ferns bush rockspirea tansybush lewis mockorange and even the limber pine tree complete soil cover and then vegetative cover can develop on these lava flows only after crevices have first become filled with soil plants exploit other means of protection to survive in this harsh environment shaded and windheltered the northern side of a cinder cone can support grass shrubs and limber pine trees while the cones southern face supports only scattered herbs most cinder cones in the park show distinct differences of plant cover between their northern and southern exposures northern exposures are cooler and more moist than southern exposures which receive far more direct sunlight in addition here at craters of the moon the prevailing southwesterly winds compound the ability of the dry heat to rob porous cinder cone surfaces and their living organisms of precious moisture the buildp of successive lava flows has so raised the landscape that it now intercepts wind currents that operate higher above surrounding plains limber pine trees find footholds on the shaded and sheltered northern exposures of cinder cones bitterbrush and rabbitbrush shrubs that can barely survive on the lower skirts of a cinder cones southern side may grow twohirds of the way up its protected northern face for many species of plants the limits of habitability on this volcanic landscape are narrowly defined very small variations in their situations can determine success or failure travelers often ask park rangers whether or not some of the parks plants were planted by people the plants in question are dwarf buckwheats and grow in cinder gardens it is their incredibly even spacing that creates an orderliness that is easy to mistake for human design the regular spacing comes about because of the competition for moisture however the root systems of these plants exploit the available water from an area of ground surface much larger than the spread of their foliage in this way mature plants can fend off competition by using the moisture that would be required for a potentially encroaching plant to become established the effect is an even spacing that makes it appear indeed as though someone had set out the plants on measured centers craters of the moon abounds with these surprising plant microhabitats that delight explorers on foot the bleak lava flows separate these emerging pockets of new life isolating them like islands or oases within their barren volcanic surroundings scientists have studied carey kipuka an island of plantlife in the most southern part of the park to find out what changes have occurred in the biologic community ipuka is a hawaiian name given to an area of older land that is surrounded by younger lava flows recent lava flows did not overrun carey kipuka so its plant cover is unaltered shortage of water protected it from livestock grazing that might have changed its character its vegetation is a benchmark for comparing plant cover changes on similar sites throughout southern idaho for the national park service and other managers of wildlands kipukasrepresenting isolated and pristine plant habitat unchanged by human influenceprovide the best answer that we have to the important question what is natural armed with a satisfactory answer to that question it is possible to manage the land ecologically park managers can seek to restore natural systems and to allow them to be as selfegulating as possible it is ironic that craters of the moon a volcanic landscape subjected to profound change should also protect this informative glimpse of what remains unchanged llustration rom the parks mazes of jumbled rock ground squirrels fashion homes with many entrances and exits opportunistic feeders on vegetable matter these engaging

researcher began a threeear study of the mule deer herd that summers in the park the immediate concern was that the deer protected inside the park might be overpopulating their range and endangering their habitat griffith set out to find out just how the deer use the area what their population level is and how certain factorsproduction mortality and distributionaffect their population dynamics the mule deer use the park april through november only because winter brings snows too deep for the deer to find food here the most striking finding of griffiths research is that the mule deer at craters of the moonunlike mule deer studied elsewherehave a dual summer range put simply the mule deer have had to undergo behavior modification to live here the deer move back into the southern park in midpril living in the protected wilderness area there while in the wilderness area the parks deer routinely live up to nearly 10 miles from open water getting their water from food dew fog and temporary puddles this area has higher quality forage for these deer than any other part of their annual range the tradeff is that the wilderness area has almost no open water when the moisture content of their forage decreases in summer usually in july the deer move up to the northern part of the park where there is open water their habits in the northern part of the park are unusual too griffith says because there the deer live in much closer quarters than other herds are known to tolerate on summer ranges they live in this wildlife equivalent of an apartment complex until the fall rains come then they move back down to the wilderness area the deer make this unusual summer migration griffith suggests to avail themselves of the high quality forage in the southern park the park serves as an island of high quality habitat for mule deer he wrote in his report it is now known the deer will leave the wilderness area for the northern park after 12 days with daytime highs above 80f and nighttime lows above 50f in summer we cant really predict this park ranger neil king says but the deer know when this is what is happening is that the percentage of water in their forage plants falls below what is necessary to sustain the deer with increasingly hot weather as you would expect does nursing two fawns leave a couple days earlier than does with only one fawn the rate at which their fawns survive to the fall of the year is astonishing this is an incredibly productive herd griffith says right up there with the highest fawn survival rate of any western mule deer herd park rangers continue griffiths studies by taking deer census counts llustration ap showing fall summer and spring migrations llustration he northern shoshone regularly passed through the craters of the moon area on their annual summer migration from the snake river to the camas prairie west of the park they took this journey to get out of the hot desert and into the cooler mountains there they could gather root crops and hunt marmots jackrabbits porcupines and ground squirrels as they passed through todays park they left behind arrowheads choppers and scrapers and built stone circles that may have been used for ceremonial purposes these artifacts and structures are evidence the indians were temporary visitors to this vast volcanic landscape indians early explorers and practicing astronauts not surprisingly archeologists have concluded that indians did not make their homes on this immense lava field astronauts would one day trek about craters of the moon in hopes that experiencing its harshly alien environment would make walking on the moon less disorienting for them no wonder people have not chosen to live on these hot black sometimes sharp lava flows on which you must line the flight of doves to locate drinking water indians did traverse this area on annual summer migrations however as shown by the developed trails and many sites where artifacts of northern shoshone culture have been found most of these archeological sites are not easily discerned by the untrained eye but the stone windbreaks at indian tunnel are easily examined rings of rocks that may have been used for temporary shelter hunting blinds or religious purposes numerous stone tools and the hammerstones and chippings of arrowhead making are found scattered throughout the lava flows some of the harder dense volcanic materials found here were made into crude cutting and scraping tools and projectile points such evidence suggests only short forays into the lavas for hunting or collecting by small groups the northern shoshone were a hunting and gathering culture directly dependent on what the land offered they turned what they could of this volcanic environment to their benefit before settlement by europeans the vicinity of the park boasted several game species that are rare or absent from craters of the moon today these included elk wolf bison grizzly and black bear and the cougar bighorn sheep whose males sport characteristic headgear of large curled horns have been absent from the park since about 1920 military explorer u army capt b bonneville left impressions of the craters of the moon lava field in his travel diaries in the early 1800s in he adventures of captain bonneville which were based on the diaries 19thentury author washington irving pictures a place where nothing meets the eye but a desolate and awful waste where no grass grows nor water runs and where nothing is to be seen but lava irving is perhaps most famous for he legend of sleepy hollow but his dventures is considered a significant period work about the west and provided this early if brief glimpse of a then unnamed craters of the moon pioneers working westward in the 19th century sought either gold or affordable farm or ranch lands so they like the northern shoshone bypassed these lava wastes later nearby settlers would venture into this area in search of additional grazing lands finding none they left craters of the moon substantially alone early pioneers who left traces in the vicinity of the park did so by following what eventually came to be known as goodales cutoff the route was based on indian trails that skirted the lava fields in the northern section of the park it came into use in the early 1850s as an alternate to the regular route of the oregon trail shoshone indian hostilities along the snake river part of the trailone such incident is memorialized in idahos massacre rocks state parkled the emigrants to search for a safer route they were headed for oregon particularly the walla walla area around whitman mission family groups in search of agricultural lands for settlement emigrants traveling it in 1854 noticed names carved in rocks and trees along its route it was named in 1862 by travelers apparently grateful to their guide tim goodale whose presence they felt had prevented indian attacks illinoisorn goodale was cut in the mold of the typical early trapper and trader of the far west he was known to the famous fur trade brothers solomon and william sublette his name turned up at such fur trade locales as pueblo taos fort bridger and fort laramie over a period of at least 20 years after the discovery of gold in idahos salmon river country a party of emigrants persuaded goodale to guide them over the route they would name for him goodale was an experienced guide in 1861 he had served in that capacity for a military survey west of denver the large band of emigrants set out in july and was joined by more wagons at craters of the moon eventually their numbers included 795 men and 300 women and children indian attacks occurred frequently along the oregon trail at that time but the size of this group evidently discouraged such incursions the trip was not without incident but goodales reputation remained sufficiently intact for his clients to affix his name to the route subsequent modifications and the addition of a ferry crossing on the snake river made goodales cutoff into a popular route for western emigration traces of it are still visible in the vicinity of the park today curiosity about this uninhabitable area eventually led to more detailed knowledge of craters of the moon and knowledge led to its preservation geologists israel c russell and harold t stearns of the u geological survey explored here in 1901 and 1923 respectively taxidermisturnedecturer robert limbert explored the area in the early 1920s limbert made three trips on the first two he more or less retraced the steps of these geologists on his third and most ambitious trek limbert and w l cole traversed what is now the park and the craters of the moon wilderness area south to north starting from the nearby community of minidoka their route took them by two point butte echo crater big craters north crater flow and out to the old arcoarey road then known as the yellowstone park and lincoln highway these explorations and their attendant publicity in ational geographic magazine were instrumental in the proclamation of craters of the moon as a national monument by president calvin coolidge in 1924 since limberts day astronauts have walked both here and on the moon despite our now detailed knowledge of the differences between these two places the nameand much of the parks awenspiring appealremains the same it is

10 paces evidently capone declined limbert made three treks into the lava fields between 1921 and 1924 he first explored the more easily accessible northern portion of the lava fields limberts third

for after three days travel his feet were worn raw and bleeding limbert said it was pitiful to watch the dog as it hobbled after them the landscape was so unusual that limbert and cole had difficulty estimating distances things would be half again as far away as they had reckoned in some areas their compass needles went wild with magnetic distortions caused by high concentrations of iron in the
