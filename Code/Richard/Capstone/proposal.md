#Travel Journal App by Richard Watkins#

###Project Overview###
this will be an app that allows for travel blogging or journalling that will also display a map of the states with entries.  My inspiration is that I have a goal of catching a fish in every state and would like to able to display a map of where I have done so.  Also recording notes and pictures from these entries will be worthwhile in remembering whatever goal a person has in journalling their goal.  

I think this could be useful for any journey or goal a person might envision, whether it is hiking, camping, petting a cat, or having a date in all 50 states.

###Functionality###
users will be able to register and login.  Login takes the user to a profile pge where they can create entries, view entries, edit entries, delete entries, view a map of states with entries, or logout.

###Data Model###
I will need a model to render the states or outlines of their borders for display.  I plan to have outlines for all 50 states.

I will also a database for user entries. user entries will have input fields for Title, Location(state), Date, and Notes.  I want to allow picture upload for entires (0-3 pictures).  Require Title, and Location entries.  automatically add the date created or last edited.
