            Hi! I'm Richard Watkins.  I am learning coding and web development with PDX Code Guild!  I have worked with Python, HTML, CSS, Flask among other things.  I am interested in infosec, coding, web development and hardware as far as computers go.  I am learning more everyday.

            I have been an Army Leader, Field Engineer for construction materials, and a Boy Scout Leader.

            Away from the keyboard, I enjoy fishing, backpacking and most things outdoors.  I also love learning skills of all kinds, podcasts, classic fiction, and meeting new people.
